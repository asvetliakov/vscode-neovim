[Neovim](https://neovim.io/) is a fork of VIM to allow greater extensibility and integration. This extension uses a full
embedded Neovim instance, no more half-complete VIM emulation! VSCode's native functionality is used for insert mode and
editor commands, making the best use of both editors.

-   üéâ Almost fully feature-complete VIM integration by utilizing neovim as a backend.
-   üîß Supports custom `init.vim` and many vim plugins.
-   ü•á First-class and lag-free insert mode, letting VSCode do what it does best.
-   ü§ù Complete integration with VSCode features (lsp/autocompletion/snippets/multi-cursor/etc).

## üß∞ Installation

-   Install the [vscode-neovim](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=asvetliakov.vscode-neovim)
    extension.
-   Install [Neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/wiki/Installing-Neovim) **0.5.0 nightly** or greater.
    -   You can install neovim separately for vscode, outside your system's package manager installation.
    -   Set the neovim path in the extension settings. You must specify full path to neovim, like
        "`C:\Neovim\bin\nvim.exe"` or "`/usr/local/bin/nvim`".
    -   The setting id is "`vscode-neovim.neovimExecutablePaths.win32/linux/darwin`", respective to your system.
-   If you want to use neovim from WSL, set the `useWSL` configuration toggle and specify linux path to nvim binary.
    `wsl.exe` windows binary and `wslpath` linux binary are required for this. `wslpath` must be available through
    `$PATH` linux env setting. Use `wsl --list` to check for the correct default linux distribution.

> ‚ùó **Neovim 0.5 nightly** or greater is **required**. Any version lower than that won't work. Many linux distributions
> have an **old** version of neovim in their package repo - always check what version are you installing.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è If you get "Unable to init vscode-neovim: command 'type' already exists" message, uninstall other VSCode extensions
> that register `type` command (i.e. [VSCodeVim](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscodevim.vim) or
> [Overtype](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=adammaras.overtype)).

> üêõ See the [issues section](https://github.com/asvetliakov/vscode-neovim/issues) for known issues.

## üí° Tips and Features

### Important

-   If you already have a big `init.vim` it is recommended to wrap existing settings & plugins with
    [`if !exists('g:vscode')`](#determining-if-running-in-vscode-in-your-initvim) to prevent potential conflicts. If you
    have any problems, try with empty `init.vim` first.
-   Visual modes don't produce vscode selections, so any vscode commands expecting selection won't work. To round the
    corners, invoking the VSCode command picker from visual mode through the default hotkeys
    (<kbd>f1</kbd>/<kbd>ctrl/cmd+shift+p</kbd>) converts vim selection to real vscode selection. This conversion is done
    automatically for some commands like commenting and formatting.
-   If you're using some custom mapping for calling vscode commands that depends on real vscode selection, you can use
    `VSCodeNotifyRange`/`VSCodeNotifyRangePos` (the first one linewise, the latter characterwise) functions which will
    convert visual mode selection to vscode selection before calling the command. See
    [this for example](https://github.com/asvetliakov/vscode-neovim/blob/e61832119988bb1e73b81df72956878819426ce2/vim/vscode-code-actions.vim#L42-L54)
    and
    [mapping](https://github.com/asvetliakov/vscode-neovim/blob/e61832119988bb1e73b81df72956878819426ce2/vim/vscode-code-actions.vim#L98).
-   The extension works best if `editor.scrollBeyondLastLine` is disabled.
-   When you type some commands they may be substituted for the another, like `:write` will be replaced by `:Write`.
    This is normal.
-   File/tab/window management (`:w`/`:q`/etc) commands are substituted and mapped to vscode actions. If you're using
    some custom commands/custom mappings to them, you might need to rebind them to call vscode actions instead. See
    reference links below for examples if you want to use custom keybindings/commands. **do not** use vim `:w`, etc in
    scripts/keybindings, they won't work.
-   On a Mac, the <kbd>h</kbd>, <kbd>j</kbd>, <kbd>k</kbd> and <kbd>l</kbd> movement keys may not repeat when held, to
    fix this open Terminal and execute the following command:
    `defaults write com.microsoft.VSCode ApplePressAndHoldEnabled -bool false`.

### VSCode specific differences

-   <kbd>=</kbd>, <kbd>==</kbd> are mapped to `editor.action.formatSelection`
-   It's possible to call vscode commands from neovim. See `VSCodeCall/VSCodeNotify` vim functions in
    `vscode-neovim.vim` file. `VSCodeCall` is blocking request, while `VSCodeNotify` is not (see below).
-   Scrolling is done by VSCode side. <kbd>C-d</kbd>/<kbd>C-u</kbd>/etc are slightly different.
-   File management commands such as <kbd>e</kbd> / <kbd>w</kbd> / <kbd>q</kbd> / etc are mapped to corresponding vscode
    commands and behavior may be different (see below).
-   <kbd>gd</kbd>/<kbd>C-]</kbd> are mapped to `editor.action.revealDefinition` (Shortcut `F12`), also <kbd>C-]</kbd>
    works in vim help files.
-   <kbd>gf</kbd> is mapped to `editor.action.revealDeclaration`
-   <kbd>gH</kbd> is mapped to `editor.action.referenceSearch.trigger`
-   <kbd>gD</kbd>/<kbd>gF</kbd> are mapped to `editor.action.peekDefinition` and `editor.action.peekDeclaration`
    respectively.
-   <kbd>C-w</kbd> <kbd>gd</kbd>/<kbd>C-w</kbd> <kbd>gf</kbd> are mapped to `editor.action.revealDefinitionAside`.
-   <kbd>gh</kbd> is mapped to `editor.action.showHover`
-   Dot-repeat (<kbd>.</kbd>) is slightly different - moving the cursor within a change range won't break the repeat
    sequence. In neovim, if you type `abc<cursor>` in insert mode, then move cursor to `a<cursor>bc` and type `1` here
    the repeat sequence would be `1`. However in vscode it would be `a1bc`. Another difference is that when you delete
    some text in insert mode, dot repeat only works from right-to-left, meaning it will treat <kbd>Del</kbd> key as
    <kbd>BS</kbd> keys when running dot repeat.

### Performance problems

If you have any performance problems (cursor jitter usually) make sure you're not using these kinds of extensions:

-   Anything that renders decorators very often:
    -   Line number extensions (VSCode has built-in support for normal/relative line numbers)
    -   Indent guide extensions (VSCode has built-in indent guides)
    -   Brackets highlighter extensions (VSCode has built-in feature)
-   VSCode extensions that delay the extension host like "Bracket Pair Colorizer"
-   VIM plugins that increase latency and cause performance problems. - Make sure to disable unneeded plugins, as many
    of them don't make sense with vscode and may cause problems. - You don't need any code, highlighting, completion,
    lsp plugins as well any plugins that spawn windows/buffers (nerdtree and similar), fuzzy-finders plugins, etc. - You
    might want to keep navigation/text-objects/text-editing/etc plugins - they should be fine.

If you're not sure, disable all other extensions, **reload vscode/window** and see if the problem persists before
reporting.

### Custom escape keys

Since VSCode is responsible for insert mode, custom insert-mode vim mappings don't work. To map composite escape keys,
put into your keybindings.json:

for <kbd>jj</kbd>

```json
{
    "command": "vscode-neovim.compositeEscape1",
    "key": "j",
    "when": "neovim.mode == insert && editorTextFocus",
    "args": "j"
}
```

to enable <kbd>jk</kbd> add also:

```json
{
    "command": "vscode-neovim.compositeEscape2",
    "key": "k",
    "when": "neovim.mode == insert && editorTextFocus",
    "args": "k"
}
```

### Conditional init.vim

To determine if neovim is running in vscode, add to your init.vim:

```vim
if exists('g:vscode')
    " VSCode extension
else
    " ordinary neovim
endif
```

To conditionally enable plugins, `vim-plug` has a
[few solutions](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug/wiki/tips#conditional-activation). For example, using the `Cond`
helper, you can conditionally activate installed plugins
([source](https://github.com/asvetliakov/vscode-neovim/issues/415#issuecomment-715533865)):

```vim
" inside plug#begin:
" use normal easymotion when in vim mode
Plug 'easymotion/vim-easymotion', Cond(!exists('g:vscode'))
" use vscode easymotion when in vscode mode
Plug 'asvetliakov/vim-easymotion', Cond(exists('g:vscode'), { 'as': 'vsc-easymotion' })
```

### Invoking VSCode actions from neovim

There are
[few helper functions](https://github.com/asvetliakov/vscode-neovim/blob/ecd361ff1968e597e2500e8ce1108830e918cfb8/vim/vscode-neovim.vim#L17-L39)
that could be used to invoke any vscode commands:

-   `VSCodeNotify(command, ...)`/`VSCodeCall(command, ...)` - invoke vscode command with optional arguments.
-   `VSCodeNotifyRange(command, line1, line2, leaveSelection ,...)`/`VSCodeCallRange(command, line1, line2, leaveSelection, ...)` -
    produce real linewise vscode selection from line1 to line2 and invoke vscode command. Put 1 for `leaveSelection`
    argument to leave vscode selection after invoking the command.
-   `VSCodeNotifyRangePos(command, line1, line2, pos1, pos2, leaveSelection ,...)`/`VSCodeCallRangePos(command, line1, line2, pos1, pos2, leaveSelection, ...)` -
    produce real characterwise vscode selection from line1.pos1 to line2.pos2 and invoke vscode command.

Functions with `Notify` in their name are non-blocking, the ones with `Call` are blocking. Generally **use Notify**
unless you really need a blocking call.

_Examples_:

Produce linewise selection and show vscode commands (default binding)

```vim
function! s:showCommands()
    let startLine = line("v")
    let endLine = line(".")
    call VSCodeNotifyRange("workbench.action.showCommands", startLine, endLine, 1)
endfunction

xnoremap <silent> <C-P> <Cmd>call <SID>showCommands()<CR>
```

Produce characterwise selection and show vscode commands (default binding):

```vim
function! s:showCommands()
    let startPos = getpos("v")
    let endPos = getpos(".")
    call VSCodeNotifyRangePos("workbench.action.showCommands", startPos[1], endPos[1], startPos[2], endPos[2], 1)
endfunction

xnoremap <silent> <C-P> <Cmd>call <SID>showCommands()<CR>
```

Run Find in files for word under cursor in vscode:

```vim
nnoremap <silent> ? <Cmd>call VSCodeNotify('workbench.action.findInFiles', { 'query': expand('<cword>')})<CR>
```

Open definition aside (default binding):

```vim
nnoremap <silent> <C-w>gd <Cmd>call VSCodeNotify('editor.action.revealDefinitionAside')<CR>
```

### Jumplist

VSCode's jumplist is used instead of Neovim's. This is to make VSCode native navigation (mouse click, jump to
definition, ect) navigable through the jumplist.

Make sure to bind to `workbench.action.navigateBack` / `workbench.action.navigateForward` if you're using custom
mappings. Marks (both upper & lowercased) should be fine.

### Wildmenu completion

Command menu has the wildmenu completion on type. The completion options appear after 1.5s (to not bother you when you
write `:w` or `:noh`). <kbd>Up</kbd>/<kbd>Down</kbd> selects the option and <kbd>Tab</kbd> accepts it. See the gif:

![wildmenu](/images/wildmenu.gif)

### Multiple cursors

Multiple cursors work in:

1. Insert mode
2. (Optional) Visual line mode
3. (Optional) Visual block mode

To spawn multiple cursors from visual line/block modes type <kbd>ma</kbd>/<kbd>mA</kbd> or <kbd>mi</kbd>/<kbd>mI</kbd>
(by default). The effect differs:

-   For visual line mode <kbd>mi</kbd> will start insert mode on each selected line on the first non whitespace
    character and <kbd>ma</kbd> will on the end of line.
-   For visual block mode <kbd>mi</kbd> will start insert on each selected line before the cursor block and
    <kbd>ma</kbd> after.
-   <kbd>mA</kbd>/<kbd>mI</kbd> versions account empty lines too (only for visual line mode, for visual block mode
    they're same as <kbd>ma</kbd>/<kbd>mi</kbd>).

See gif in action:

![multicursors](/images/multicursor.gif)

### Keyboard Quickfix

By default, the quickfix menu can be opened using <kbd>z=</kbd> or <kbd>C-.</kbd>. However, it is currently
[not possible](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/55111) to add mappings to the quickfix menu, so it can only be
navigated with arrow keys. A
[workaround vscode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=pascalsenn.keyboard-quickfix) has been
made to use the quick open menu, which can be navigated with custom bindings.

To use, install the
[keyboard-quickfix](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=pascalsenn.keyboard-quickfix) extension, and add
to your keybindings.json:

```jsonc
{
    "key": "ctrl+.",
    "command": "keyboard-quickfix.openQuickFix",
    "when": "editorHasCodeActionsProvider && editorTextFocus && !editorReadonly"
},
```

and add to your init.vim:

```vim
nnoremap z= <Cmd>call VSCodeNotify('keyboard-quickfix.openQuickFix')<CR>
```

### Custom keybindings

Control keys which are not in the above tables are not sent to neovim by default. To pass additional ctrl keys to
neovim, for example <kbd>C-Tab</kbd>, add to your keybindings.json:

```jsonc
{
    "command": "vscode-neovim.send",
    // the key sequence to activate the binding
    "key": "ctrl+tab",
    // don't activate during insert mode
    "when": "editorTextFocus && neovim.mode != insert",
    // the input to send to neovim
    "args": "<C-Tab>"
}
```

To disable existing an ctrl key sequence, for example <kbd>C-A</kbd> add to your keybindings.json:

```json
{
    "command": "-vscode-neovim.send",
    "key": "ctrl+a"
}
```

## ü§ù Vim Plugins

Most vim plugins will work out of the box, but certain plugins may require some fixes to work properly.

### vim-easymotion

While the original [vim-easymotion](https://github.com/easymotion/vim-easymotion) functions as expected, it works by
replacing your text with markers then restoring back, which leads to broken text and many errors reported in VSCode.

For this reason I created the special [vim-easymotion fork](https://github.com/asvetliakov/vim-easymotion) which doesn't
touch your text and instead use vscode text decorations. Just add my fork to your `vim-plug` block or by using your
favorite vim plugin installer and delete original vim-easymotion. Also overwin motions won't work (obviously) so don't
use them.

By default, text decorations will appear behind of the associated text as shown in the screenshot. To show the
decorations on top of the text, set `vscode-neovim.textDecorationsAtTop` to true.

Happy jumping!

### vim-commentary

You can use [vim-commentary](https://github.com/tpope/vim-commentary) if you like it. But vscode already has such
functionality so why don't use it? Add to your init.vim/init.nvim:

```vim
xmap gc  <Plug>VSCodeCommentary
nmap gc  <Plug>VSCodeCommentary
omap gc  <Plug>VSCodeCommentary
nmap gcc <Plug>VSCodeCommentaryLine
```

Similar to vim-commentary, gcc is comment line (accept count), use gc with motion/in visual mode. `VSCodeCommentary` is
just a simple function which calls `editor.action.commentLine`.

### quick-scope

[quick-scope](https://github.com/unblevable/quick-scope) plugin uses default vim HL groups by default but they are
normally ignored. To fix, add

```vim
highlight QuickScopePrimary guifg='#afff5f' gui=underline ctermfg=155 cterm=underline
highlight QuickScopeSecondary guifg='#5fffff' gui=underline ctermfg=81 cterm=underline
```

to your init.vim. The underline color can be changed by the `guisp` tag.

## üìë How it works

-   VScode connects to neovim instance
-   When opening a some file, a scratch buffer is created in nvim and being init with text content from vscode
-   Normal/visual mode commands are being sent directly to neovim. The extension listens for buffer events and applies
    edits from neovim
-   When entering the insert mode, the extensions stops listen for keystroke events and delegates typing mode to vscode
    (no neovim communication is being performed here)
-   After pressing escape key from the insert mode, extension sends changes obtained from the insert mode to neovim
